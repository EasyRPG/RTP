EasyRPG RTP
===========

EasyRPG RTP is a material replacement bundle to play RPG Maker 2000 and 2003
games which depend on RPG Maker RTP material library.

Original RPG Maker RTP contains a set of material resources: graphics, music
and sound effects. It allows a preconfigured setup for game creation and shared
with other RPG Maker based games, saving download bandwidth and disk space.

However, original RPG Maker RTP can't be distributed freely. RPG Maker RTP
features a non-free, propietary license and only can be distributed by
authorized RPG Maker distributors. Product customers can distribute materials
but only without separating parts from games made with RPG Maker.

EasyRPG RTP aims to be the free (as in freedom) replacement compatible with
the original RPG Maker RTP allowing to distribute games with more freedom.

EasyRPG RTP is part of the EasyRPG Project. More information is available
