# EasyRPG RTP

EasyRPG RTP is a material replacement bundle to play RPG Maker 2000 and 2003
games which depend on the RPG Maker RTP material library.

EasyRPG RTP is part of the EasyRPG Project. More information is available at the
project website: <https://easyrpg.org/rtp-replacement/>

The original RPG Maker RTP contains a set of material resources:

- Graphics
- Music
- Sound effects

It allows one to have a preconfigured setup for game creation and is shared with
other RPG Maker based games, saving download bandwidth and disk space.

However, the original RPG Maker RTP can't be distributed freely. RPG Maker RTP
features a non-free, proprietary license and only can be distributed by
authorized RPG Maker distributors. Product customers can distribute materials
only after separating them from games made with RPG Maker.

EasyRPG RTP aims to be a free (as in freedom) replacement, compatible with the
original RPG Maker RTP, so that games can be distributed more freely.
