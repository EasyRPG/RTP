EasyRPG RTP
===========

EasyRPG RTP is a material replacement bundle to play RPG Maker 2000 and
2003 games which depend on RPG Maker RTP material library.

Original RPG Maker RTP contains a set of material resources: graphics,
music and sound effects. It allows a preconfigured setup for game
creation and shared with other RPG Maker based games, saving download
bandwidth and disk space.

However, original RPG Maker RTP can't be distributed freely. RPG Maker
RTP features a non-free, propietary license and only can be
distributed by authorized RPG Maker distributors. Product customers can
distribute materials but only without separating parts from games made
with RPG Maker.

EasyRPG RTP aims to be the free (as in freedom) replacement compatible
with the original RPG Maker RTP allowing to distribute games with more
freedom.

EasyRPG RTP is part of the EasyRPG Project. More information is
available at the project website:
