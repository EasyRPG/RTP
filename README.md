# EasyRPG RTP

EasyRPG RTP is a material replacement bundle to play RPG Maker 2000 and
2003 games which depend on RPG Maker RTP material library.

EasyRPG RTP is part of the EasyRPG Project. More information is
available at the project website: https://easyrpg.org/rtp-replacement/

Original RPG Maker RTP contains a set of material resources:
* Graphics
* Music
* Sound effects

It allows a preconfigured setup for game creation and shared with other
RPG Maker based games, saving download bandwidth and disk space.

However, original RPG Maker RTP can't be distributed freely. RPG Maker
RTP features a non-free, propietary license and only can be
distributed by authorized RPG Maker distributors. Product customers can
distribute materials but only without separating parts from games made
with RPG Maker.

EasyRPG RTP aims to be the free (as in freedom) replacement compatible
with the original RPG Maker RTP allowing to distribute games with more
freedom.
